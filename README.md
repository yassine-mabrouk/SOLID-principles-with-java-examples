# SOLID principles with java example 
In this repo, you will find For each principle an example with the problem and solution .
SOLID is a popular set of design principles that are used in object-oriented software development. SOLID is an acronym that stands for five key design principles:
## 1) S-Single responsibility principle
- A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.
## 2) O-Open-closed Principle
- Software entities, classes, modules, functions, etc. should be open for extension but closed for modification .
## 3) L-Liskov Substitution Principle
- Let q(x) be a property provable about objects of x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T.
- This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.
## 4) I-Interface Segregation Principle
- A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
## 5) D-Dependency Inversion Principle
- High level modules should not depend on low level modules , both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstractions should not depend on details , details should depend on abstractions.
